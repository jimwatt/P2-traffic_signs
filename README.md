# Road Sign Classifier

Given a labelled data set of German road signs, build a deep learning traffic sign classifier in TensorFlow. 
 
The major steps in this project are the following:

* Load the data set.
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set.
* Design, train and test a model architecture.
* Use the model to make predictions on new images.
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images.
* Summarize the results with a written report.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Imported packages include:

```
Python
TensorFlow
Keras
skimage
```

### Installing

No install is required --- simply clone this project from GitHub:

```
git clone https://github.com/jimwatt/P2-trafficsigns.git
```

## Running the Code

* The main python script is a Jupyter Notebook called Traffic\_Sign\_Classifier.ipynb
* Just start by running the Jupyter Notebook, and then experimenting.
* Training will be faster if this notebook is run on a GPU (through Amazon Web Services, for example).
